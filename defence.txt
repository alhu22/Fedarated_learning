malicious clients:

Median or Trimmed Mean

Trimmed Mean: Remove the largest and smallest values of each weight dimension across clients, then average.

Median: Take the median of each weight dimension.

Resistant to extreme values from poisoned clients.

Krum / Multi-Krum

Krum: Selects a single client update closest to other updates.

Multi-Krum: Selects several updates with the closest neighbors.

Works well if less than 50% of clients are malicious.

Bulyan

Combination of Krum and trimmed mean.

Provides stronger robustness against high-magnitude malicious updates.
